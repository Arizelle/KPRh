Little TODOs:
 - Be able to set an offset for your version of a song (to match files)
 - Make mode: Copy, Paste, Cut


Playing chords:
 - Each Note knows its Chord
 - Tells the Chord it's being played
 - If all notes played, Chord is played
 - Else, miss all


Charting Mode controls
 - Move forward and back - Up/Down Arrow
 - Each note key
 - Increase/Decrease chart timescale/hyperspeed - Right/Left
 - Increase/Decrease play speed - Shift + Right/Left

 		- Region is defined by holding up to two(?) keys to define the box
 		- If it doesn't overlap with a region, one will be made
